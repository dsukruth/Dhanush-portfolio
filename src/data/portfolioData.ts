  bio: "As a Software Test Engineer at ISRO - Indian Space Research Organization, I have been working on upgrading critical software tools for the Chandrayaan-3 mission. I have successfully reduced the time required for software testing of the spacecraft by nearly 75% using tools such as Python, Ansible, and Shell Script. I am also a co-founder of 16bits, where I gained valuable experience in software development and project management. I am currently pursuing my Master's degree in Information Systems at the University of Maryland - Robert H. Smith School of Business, with a focus on software development and quality assurance. I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve complex problems and improve efficiency.",
